# week1 - embeddings & nlp
## Day 1 Notes

- embeddings: numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning
- semantic similarity: measures similarity in meaning using cosine similarity between embeddings
- tokenization: splitting text into tokens that models can process
- preprocessing: cleaning text (lowercasing, removing urls, splitting sentences)
- tf-idf vs embeddings: tf-idf is keyword-based, embeddings capture meaning
